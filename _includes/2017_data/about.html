                        Leigh Silverstein was born in and never really left Toronto. He grew up in the '90s watching an uncanny amount of television and movies. He now has a partner of more than a decade and two young children. He went to school for film studies after high school, but decided to become a software developer when he realized he could not feed his children camera parts.
